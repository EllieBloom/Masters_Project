## Exploring REACT and postcode mapping data samples

# Date started: 23rd May 2022

# Exploring REACT data fields and mapping of locations/postcodes to other areas 
# e.g. Google Metrpolitan and Non-Metrpolitan Counties in Engalnd

# Looking at possible location mapping - variables of interest

# Region ID - 1(NE), 2(NW), 3(Yorkshire and Humber), 4(EM), 5(WM), 6(EE), H(LON), J(SE)
table(R17$region_id)

# lacode - not sure what each of these mean...?
table(R17$lacode)

# LSOA - not sure what each of these mean - similar to lacode
table(R17$lsoa)

# output_area - not sure what each of these mean - similar to lacode and LSOA
table(R17$output_area)

# u_region - same as region but with names of regions as well as codes - easier to use
table(R17$u_region)

# postcode

# May be able to use a postcode lookup to map between areas:

# Overall postcode lookup is very large!
